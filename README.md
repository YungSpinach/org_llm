Hello, Id like to build a LLM app for my consulting business that uses an open source LLM like LLama or Deep Seek to provide more nuanced and context-driven querying after being exposed to multiple documents owned by my business. Can you take me through the steps of how to do this please? I'd ideally like to code in python and host with a Streamlit app
Building a LLM (Large Language Model) app for your consulting business is a great idea! Below, I’ll walk you through the steps to create such an app using an open-source LLM like LLaMA or DeepSeek, Python, and Streamlit for hosting. This app will allow you to upload documents, process them, and provide nuanced, context-driven querying.

Step 1: Define the Scope and Requirements
Purpose: The app will allow users to upload documents (e.g., PDFs, Word files, or text files), process them, and query the LLM for context-aware responses.

Features:

Document upload and processing.

Context-aware querying using the LLM.

A simple and intuitive user interface.

Tech Stack:

Python for backend logic.

Streamlit for the frontend and hosting.

An open-source LLM like LLaMA or DeepSeek.

Libraries for document processing (e.g., PyPDF2, LangChain, etc.).

Step 2: Set Up Your Environment
Install Python: Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed.

Create a Virtual Environment:

bash
Copy
python -m venv llm-app-env
source llm-app-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: llm-app-env\Scripts\activate
Install Required Libraries:

bash
Copy
pip install streamlit langchain pypdf2 sentence-transformers faiss-cpu transformers torch
Step 3: Choose and Load the LLM
Select an Open-Source LLM:

LLaMA (Meta) or DeepSeek are good options. You can use Hugging Face’s transformers library to load these models.

Alternatively, use a smaller, fine-tuned model like flan-t5 or gpt-neo for faster performance.

Load the Model:

python
Copy
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "deepseek-ai/deepseek-llm"  # Replace with your chosen model
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
Step 4: Document Processing
Upload and Extract Text:

Use libraries like PyPDF2 or docx to extract text from uploaded documents.

python
Copy
import PyPDF2

def extract_text_from_pdf(file):
    reader = PyPDF2.PdfReader(file)
    text = ""
    for page in reader.pages:
        text += page.extract_text()
    return text
Chunk the Text:

Split the text into smaller chunks for better context handling.

python
Copy
from langchain.text_splitter import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

def chunk_text(text, chunk_size=500, chunk_overlap=50):
    splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=chunk_size, chunk_overlap=chunk_overlap)
    chunks = splitter.split_text(text)
    return chunks
Step 5: Build the Querying System
Embed Text Chunks:

Use a sentence transformer to create embeddings for the text chunks.

python
Copy
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer

embedder = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
embeddings = embedder.encode(chunks)
Set Up a Vector Database:

Use FAISS for efficient similarity search.

python
Copy
import faiss

index = faiss.IndexFlatL2(embeddings.shape[1])
index.add(embeddings)
Query the LLM:

Combine the retrieved context with the user’s query for a nuanced response.

python
Copy
def query_llm(query, context, model, tokenizer, max_length=512):
    input_text = f"Context: {context}\n\nQuery: {query}"
    inputs = tokenizer(input_text, return_tensors="pt", max_length=max_length, truncation=True)
    outputs = model.generate(**inputs)
    return tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
Step 6: Build the Streamlit App
Set Up the UI:

Use Streamlit to create a simple interface for uploading documents and querying.

python
Copy
import streamlit as st

st.title("LLM-Powered Consulting App")
uploaded_files = st.file_uploader("Upload your documents", type=["pdf", "docx", "txt"], accept_multiple_files=True)
query = st.text_input("Enter your query")

if uploaded_files and query:
    # Process documents
    texts = []
    for file in uploaded_files:
        if file.type == "application/pdf":
            texts.append(extract_text_from_pdf(file))
        elif file.type == "text/plain":
            texts.append(file.read().decode("utf-8"))
    chunks = chunk_text(" ".join(texts))

    # Generate embeddings and query
    embeddings = embedder.encode(chunks)
    index.add(embeddings)
    D, I = index.search(embedder.encode([query]), k=1)
    context = chunks[I[0][0]]

    # Get LLM response
    response = query_llm(query, context, model, tokenizer)
    st.write("Response:", response)
Step 7: Deploy the App
Host on Streamlit Cloud:

Push your code to a GitHub repository.

Sign up for Streamlit Cloud and connect your repository.

Deploy the app directly from the repository.

Alternative Hosting:

Use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku if you need more control.

Step 8: Test and Iterate
Test the app with real documents and queries.

Fine-tune the LLM or adjust the chunking and embedding process for better performance.

Add features like user authentication, logging, or analytics as needed.

Example Code Repository
Here’s a minimal example structure for your project:

Copy
llm-app/
│
├── app.py               # Streamlit app
├── requirements.txt     # Dependencies
├── documents/           # Folder for uploaded documents
└── README.md            # Documentation
Next Steps
Experiment with different LLMs and fine-tune them for your specific domain.

Optimize the app for performance, especially if dealing with large documents.

Add security features if handling sensitive data.

Let me know if you need further clarification or help with any step!
